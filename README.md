# Nelligan-api

[![CI](https://github.com/julbrs/nelligan-api/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/julbrs/nelligan-api/actions/workflows/main.yml)

JS lib that can interact with the [Nelligan Montral](http://nelligan.ville.montreal.qc.ca/)
book library system: list book on your card, check when you need to renew, renew books...
The Montreal system is based over the III Encore product so it might work with other systems
using same software.

## Getting Started

Import the lib in your project

```
yarn add nelligan-api
```

Then start using it..

```
const api = require('nelligan-api')

# define your user library card
card = {
  code: '1277777',
  pin: '1234'
}

# list actual books on the card
const books = await api.books(card)
```

Sample output:

```
{
  books:
   [ { title: 'Deception point : roman / Dan Brown ; traduit de l\'anglais (Ã‰tats-Unis) par Daniel Roche.',
       barcode: '32777041843371',
       duedate: '18-12-23',
       rid: 'renew0',
       rvalue: 'i3010099',
       record: 'b1421604',
       fine: undefined,
       renew: 0 }],
  fine: '0.60$ in unpaid fines and bills'
}
```
